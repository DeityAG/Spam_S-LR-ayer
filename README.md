Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, exploring the efficacy of various machine learning classifiers in distinguishing between spam and non-spam text messages. 
The most effective ML model found was Logistic regresiion model.

By comparing traditional ML classifiers with state-of-the-art Language Model fine-tuning approaches, we aim to uncover the most effective strategy for SMS filtering.
